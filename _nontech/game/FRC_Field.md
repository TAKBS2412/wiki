{% include TODO %}

The FRC Competition has used a standard sized field since the 2000 game, [Cooperition First](co-opertition-first) . The interior of the field has an approximate size of 26 ft 7 in by 54 ft 1 in, and is covered by [Shaw Flooring Neyland II 20 Carpet](https://shawfloors.com/flooring/carpet/details/neyland-ii-20-50510/scotch-pine). Each year's game has different colors for the carpet, including some games such as [Recycle Rush](recycle-rush) which was split into two sides of two colors (in that case, red and blue for each alliance).

There are a variety of field configurations that switch out between each year. Each short side of the field will contain three Alliance Stations. Each alliance station is 5 ft 10 in wide (the shelf for laptops is smaller) and 6 ft 6 in tall. There is aluminum diamond plate that extends 3 ft up, then transparent plastic panel. There is a shelf for drive laptops and controls which is 5 ft 9 in wide and 1 ft deep, featuring a piece of hook and loop tape (loop side) that is 4 ft 6 in long by 2 in wide.

There are two side panels adjacent to the three driver stations on each side which feature game elements. These vary per year, but features two main designs: a flat, parallel to the driver station panel and and a angled panel from the driver station to the side panel. For example, the [2014 game](aerial-assist) features two parallel platforms on each side of the driver stations, which features a "low goal" on the bottom half of the panel, while the [2015 game](recycle-rush) features a angled side panel which [human players](human-players) can introduce totes through. The field usually alternate between these two deigns each year.

The long sides of the field feature guardrails designed to keep robots from escaping from the field during the match. It features four gates on the field allowing for easy access on and off the field. These gates are 3 ft 2 in wide and feature two ramps on each side that fold down when the game is open, but is locked by an bar that slots them into place.

## Wooden Replicas

[Andymark](andymark) designed a FRC wooden field in 2008, which still should be good enough for most purposes. The basic design for the competition field has not changed since 2008 (other than the alternating side panels). This design features both types of side panels. It does not include any game specific elements, nor any suggested way of mounting such a thing. You can see the design files here: http://files.andymark.com/2008-FRC-wooden-field-border.pdf
